KS3 Science github
Building a better KS3

The purpose of this github experiment is to see if we can collaborate over the writing and resourcing of an entire Science KS3 SOW and heck, possibly create a text book to accompany to course.

Upfront, this is a collaborative project, with all resources submitted as OpenSource, and shared under the CC license (need details here)
